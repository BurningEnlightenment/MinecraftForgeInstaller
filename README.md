# MinecraftForge Installer
A simple installer for creating Launcher profiles. [Original Project](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/Installer)

# About This Fork
I added two command line switches which can be used to configure the installation instead of the option dialog:
- `--type <CLIENT|SERVER>` and its shorthand `-t=<CLIENT|SERVER>`
- `--directory <install-dir>` and its shorthand `-d=<install-dir>`
